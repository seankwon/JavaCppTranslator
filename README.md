# A java to cpp translator

A final project done for my object oriented programming class in my fall
semester of my junior year. A team of four others and I created a java to c
plus plus translator that interpreted java objects and classes into c++
structs and vtables. It was not entirely finished on completion, and bugs still
exist in the code. The project used an API known as xtc which provided abstract
syntax trees for java syntax. My most commendable contributions to the project were
implementing smart pointers that simulated dynamic casting and method
overloading / inheritance. On top of that, miscellanous other tasks.

1. You need a java library called xtc.
2. "make program"
3. "java Sentinel [name of java test file]"
4. "g++ main.h"
5. "g++ main.cc"
6. "./a.out"
7. done
